# MEDICATION OPTIMIZATION TIMELINE
## Safe Tapering and Adjustment Schedule to Resolve Syncope
**Created:** 2025-09-02  
**Urgency:** IMMEDIATE START REQUIRED  
**Goal:** Eliminate medication-induced syncope while maintaining BP control

---

## CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE
**Current Regimen is DANGEROUS:**
- Triple antihypertensive therapy causing syncope
- Metoprolol contraindicated with syncope history
- Simvastatin dosing error (BID instead of QHS)
- Multiple drug interactions active

**This timeline will safely correct these issues**

---

## WEEK 1: IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Days 1-7)
### Start Date: TODAY

#### Day 1 (TODAY):
```
MORNING:
□ Call doctor for urgent appointment
□ Request orthostatic vital signs
□ Start BP diary (lying and standing)
□ Document any syncope/dizziness

MEDICATION CHANGES:
□ Simvastatin: Change from 20mg BID to 40mg at bedtime
□ Continue all other medications as prescribed
□ DO NOT stop any medication abruptly

SAFETY MEASURES:
□ Stand slowly - count to 10
□ Increase water intake to 2L/day
□ Avoid hot showers/baths
□ Have someone check on you daily
```

#### Days 2-7:
```
METOPROLOL REDUCTION - PHASE 1:

```

---

## WEEK 3: FINAL METOPROLOL TAPER (Days 15-21)

#### Days 15-21:
```

```

---

## WEEK 4: OPTIMIZATION (Days 22-28)

#### Assessment and Adjustment:
```
IF BP WELL CONTROLLED (120-140/70-85):
→ Continue Candesartan 8mg + Amlodipin 5mg
→ No changes needed

IF BP TOO LOW (<120/70 consistently):
→ Reduce Amlodipin to 2.5mg daily
   OR
→ Reduce Candesartan to 4mg daily

IF BP TOO HIGH (>150/90 consistently):
→ Increase Candesartan to 16mg daily
   OR
→ Increase Amlodipin to 10mg daily
→ Do NOT restart Metoprolol

IF SYNCOPE PERSISTS:
→ This suggests non-medication cause
→ Proceed with neurological evaluation
```

## COMMUNICATION SCRIPTS

### For Urgent Doctor Call (Day 1):
"I need an urgent medication review. I'm on triple blood pressure therapy with Metoprolol 100mg, Candesartan 8mg, and Amlodipin 5mg, which analysis shows is causing my syncope through severe orthostatic hypotension. I need to start tapering Metoprolol immediately for safety. Can we schedule today or tomorrow?"

### For Emergency Room (if needed):
"I'm having severe orthostatic hypotension from triple antihypertensive therapy. Currently tapering Metoprolol under medical supervision. Current medications: [list all]. ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN. Need orthostatic vitals and BP management."

### For Pharmacist Consultation:
"I'm tapering off Metoprolol due to medication-induced syncope from triple antihypertensive therapy. Can you review my medications for interactions and help me create a safe tapering schedule? Also, my Simvastatin should be once daily at bedtime, not twice daily."
