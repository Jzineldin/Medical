## STANDARD OF CARE ANALYSIS

### CLEAR VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED

#### 1. FAILURE TO PERFORM BASIC SCREENING TESTS (20-YEAR PERIOD)
**Violation:** No TSH, HbA1c, or comprehensive metabolic evaluation performed despite:
- Chronic depression with treatment resistance
- Hypertension requiring multiple medications  
- Unexplained weight fluctuations
- Recurrent syncope episodes

**Standard:** Basic endocrine and metabolic screening required for patients with:
- Treatment-resistant depression (TSH mandatory)
- Poorly controlled hypertension (diabetes screening mandatory)
- Unexplained neurological symptoms

**Legal Risk:** **HIGH** - Clear deviation from accepted practice standards

#### 2. INADEQUATE MEDICATION MONITORING
**Violation:** Duloxetin prescribed to patient with known hypertension without:
- Baseline blood pressure assessment
- Hypertension risk stratification
- Monitoring protocol establishment
- Patient education on hypertensive crisis signs

**Standard:** FDA black box warnings and prescribing information require careful monitoring of patients with cardiovascular risk factors

**Legal Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Direct causal relationship to adverse event

#### 3. FRAGMENTED CARE WITHOUT COORDINATION
**Violation:** 8+ prescribers managing complex patient with no:
- Central care coordinator
- Medication reconciliation process
- Allergy alert system coordination
- Communication between providers

**Standard:** Complex patients require coordinated care with designated primary physician responsibility

**Legal Risk:** **HIGH** - System failure contributing to adverse outcomes

#### 4. INADEQUATE ALLERGY ALERT SYSTEM
**Violation:** Life-threatening penicillin allergy not uniformly communicated across all treating facilities and providers

**Standard:** Critical allergies must be flagged in all medical records with fail-safe alert systems

**Legal Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Potential for fatal anaphylaxis if allergy not recognized
